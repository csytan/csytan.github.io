# ResHQ (2012)

ResHQ was an online appointment scheduler built for the B2B space. This was my first experience at building and maintaining a significant project by myself.

## Lessons Learned

- The MVP should have been built for individuals instead of for teams
- Building for a team made marketing more difficult and high touch as businesses  need more features than individuals
- Beta users give very valuable feedback. Listen to them!
- Calendar integration would have saved me the trouble of creating my own dashboard
