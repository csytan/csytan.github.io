# Vittyo (2010)

Vittyo was a joint project with my friend [Ivan Zhao](http://ivzhao.com/). The idea was to provide something like [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), but for streaming videos.

This was one of my first experiences building a business with another person.  Ivan did some **amazing** work on the design and front-end, while I worked on the back-end and video hosting. We both put a ton of effort into Vittyo.

Unfortunately, it did not succeed because we did not realize that marketing is just as important as product development.

I still look back on this project fondly. We both learned a ton during that time.
