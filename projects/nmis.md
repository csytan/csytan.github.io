# Nigeria MDG Information System (2013)

The [Nigeria MDG Information System](http://nmis.mdgs.gov.ng/) (NMIS) was a large scale data collection and informatics project created for the Nigerian government as part of the UN's [Millenium Development Goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals).

I was brought on to lead front-end development for this project at the [Sustainable Engineering Lab](http://sel.columbia.edu/). The bulk of the work was completed within a couple months, and the project was successfully transferred to the Nigerian government in 2014.

The [Explore page](http://nmis.mdgs.gov.ng/explore) is a single page app that uses [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/) for templating and [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) for routing.

The GitHub repo can be [found here](https://github.com/SEL-Columbia/nmis).
