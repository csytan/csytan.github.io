Your question is quite broad, so I'm going to assume you want to learn how to **forehand huck**.

To maximize distance, you need to incorporate more parts of your body into your throw.

For a forehand, these movements are: wrist snap, elbow snap, hip rotation. I'm over-simplifying of course, but only to lead into my main point.

Although you will unlock more power, your throw will change as well. The angle, the tilt of the disc, your windup, etc. Your first few throws after adding hip rotation will probably be wobbly as hell or veer off in a extremely IO or OI fashion.

Above all else, make sure your throw is **smooth**. Any wobble on a disc saps it of stability and distance. 

**SMOOTHNESS TIPS:**
- When learning in a new motion, do it gradually. Instead of immediately trying to jack it 70 yards. Start at 10 yards and gradually add in more and more power.

- Shortening the distance
- Gradually adding
