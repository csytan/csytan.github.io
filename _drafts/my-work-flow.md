As some of you may know, I'm in the process of building an appointment scheduling SAAS called [CozyCal](https://cozycal.com).

- Graham's idea
- Rob Walling, start small, stay small
- gradual change in values

Efficiency is the most important thing I've been trying to optimize since.

## Google Inbox
- "Smart procrastination for things you can do later"
    - email someone later, check if someone followed up
- smart procrastination using google inbox
    - never forget!
- keeping an empty inbox
- tasks are things you can do which bring an (ideally measurable) improvement
- tasks are often better suited to be done at a different time or location

## Google Calendar
Used for events you want to prepare for ahead of time
    - birthdays, travel, meetings
- Sunrise web-client, native iOS app
- using gcal vs inbox?
    - Inbox: if it's email related, and small tasks

## Apple Notes
- if a task remains in my inbox too long then turn it into a project
- a project is a series of tasks which bring about a desired end result
- types of notes
    - organizational: cozycal's readme
    - ideas notes
    - people
    - projects
- don't list everything out at once
- splitting tasks up into smaller actionable tasks: apple notes
 
## Myself
- always working on something that can bring a measurable result
